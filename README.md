Scripting for Gaming and Animation

I may just use this page to keep track of my notes teehee
I have taken this class before so I have most of the software downloaded 
but it was during COVID and I was taking too many classes at the time and I hella failed it
I think I'll do better this time :)

ok so when you click on a committed file, it'll open it up and you can read what it says
you can also see all the files in this commit to the right
to make a new file, you can right click on the files box where it's empty and just make a new file
to edit an existing file, right click on it

when you're editing file contents, make an initial change and then save it with ctrl save
this will put the file into WIP mode, Unstaged but editable 
This is called a File Diff
then make all your changes 
when you're done editing, stage and commit and push

Always save your file before exiting out of it, but Git will prompt you
To edit a Diff, you'll click to view it, and then hit Edit File to make another change

what happens if you make a mistake?

You can undo a commit or a staging (or maybe even a push idk) by using the fancy little undo button. 
You can unstage certain lines if you just want to get rid of them
or you can go into the text and just edit it as if it was never committed
